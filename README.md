# Rideshare Churn Predictor

This is a case study conducted by Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program to predict churn using real-world data from a ride-sharing company in San Francisco. 

A ride-sharing company (Company X) is interested in predicting rider retention. To help explore this question, we have provided a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an account in January 2014. The data was pulled on July 1, 2014; we consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip) in the preceding 30 days (from the day the data was pulled). In other words, a user is "active" if they have taken a trip since June 1, 2014. The data, churn.csv, is in the data folder. The data are split into train and test sets. 

We would like you to use this data set to help understand **what factors are
the best predictors for retention**, and offer suggestions to help Company X. 
Therefore, your task is not only to build a
model that minimizes error, but also a model that allows you to interpret the
factors that contributed to your predictions.
