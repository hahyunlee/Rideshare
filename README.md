# Rideshare Churn Predictor

This is a case study conducted by Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program to predict churn using real-world data from a ride-sharing company in San Francisco. 

A ride-sharing company (Company X) is interested in predicting rider retention. To help explore this question, we have provided a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an account in January 2014. The data was pulled on July 1, 2014; we consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip) in the preceding 30 days (from the day the data was pulled). In other words, a user is "active" if they have taken a trip since June 1, 2014. The data, churn.csv, is in the data folder. The data are split into train and test sets.
